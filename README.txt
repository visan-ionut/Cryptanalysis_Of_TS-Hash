Cryptanalysis of TS-Hash
========================

The project explores the cryptanalysis of TS-Hash, a hash
function based on a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
with dynamically chosen feedback polynomials. TS-Hash employs
a non-linear approach by triggering feedback only when needed,
adding complexity to the hashing process. The analysis includes
an algebraic formulation, expressing the hash function as
operations in finite fields. The study aims to enhance understanding
and potentially identify vulnerabilities in TS-Hash, contributing
valuable insights to the field of cryptographic research.
